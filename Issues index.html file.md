<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width, height=device-height, target-densitydpi=device-dpi" />

This line of code is used to control the layout on mobile browsers. The user-scalable=no part disables the user's ability to zoom in or out, which can be a problem for accessibility. This is because some users may need to zoom in to read the content on the page.
